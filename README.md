# Simple Quiz Application

This repo is dedicated for a simple Quiz Application that asks questions, takes True or False, and tracks total overall score. Created to understand Activities and Model View Controller (MVC) pattern.

Main Activity contains the quiz. While the SummaryScreen Activity contains the final score and exit button.

When a user answers:
  - correctly, they get 10 points
  - incorrectly, they get 0 points.
  
When a user skips a question, they get 5 points deducted on their score.

When a user clicks the "DONE" button, a new activity named SummaryScreen Activity opens a window that shows the final score of the user and an exit button that allows a user to quit the app.
